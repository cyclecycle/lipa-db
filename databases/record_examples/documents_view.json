It proposed that the brain damage leading to Alzheimer's disease was instigated by soluble, ligand-like AbetaOs. This hypothesis was based on the discovery that fibril-free synthetic preparations of AbetaOs were potent CNS neurotoxins that rapidly inhibited long-term potentiation and, with time, caused selective nerve cell death. The mechanism was attributed to disrupted signaling involving the tyrosine-protein kinase Fyn, mediated by an unknown toxin receptor. Over 4,000 articles concerning AbetaOs have been published since then, including more than 400 reviews. AbetaOs have been shown to accumulate in an AD-dependent manner in human and animal model brain tissue and, experimentally, to impair learning and memory and instigate major facets of AD neuropathology, including tau pathology, synapse deterioration and loss, inflammation, and oxidative damage. As reviewed by Hayden and Teplow in 2013, the AbetaO hypothesis \\\"has all but supplanted the amyloid cascade.\\\" Despite the emerging understanding of the role played by AbetaOs in AD pathogenesis, AbetaOs have not yet received the clinical attention given to amyloid plaques, which have been at the core of major attempts at therapeutics and diagnostics but are no longer regarded as the most pathogenic form of Abeta. However, if the momentum of AbetaO research continues, particularly efforts to elucidate key aspects of structure, a clear path to a successful disease modifying therapy can be envisioned. Ensuring that lessons learned from recent, late-stage clinical failures are applied appropriately throughout therapeutic development will further enable the likelihood of a successful therapy in the near-term.\", \"name\": \"AB\"}]}"
